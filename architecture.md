# Architecture Decisions
This file documents the key technical decisions made in this project and explains the reasoning behind our technology choices and system architecture design.

### Why we chose LlamaIndex in place of LangChain?

LlamaIndex and LangChain are both frameworks that use large language models (LLMs) for different purposes. LlamaIndex is best for data-intensive search and retrieval tasks, while LangChain is better for building a variety of NLP applications.

#### LlamaIndex
This framework is known for its speed and accuracy, and is well-suited for tasks like:
- Document search
- Enhancing large language models
- Creating Q&A chatbots
- Summarizing large documents
- Text completion
- Language translation

#### LangChain
This framework is known for its flexibility and versatility, and is well-suited for tasks like:
- Building chatbots
- Creating content generators
- Automating complex workflows
- Integrating workflows with LLMs
- Expanding data connections for LLMs
